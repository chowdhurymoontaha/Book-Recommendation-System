# Book-Recommendation-System
Recommendation System is used widely in a variety of domains ranging from recommending web pages, news articles, restaurants, television programs, and items for
sale. In this project, I have build a book recommendation system. Two different approaches, Content Based Filtering(CBF) and Collaborative Filtering(CF) are explored here. In CBF, a TF-IDF vectorizer based recommendation system
and Countvectorizer based recommendation system is applied. For top 10 recommendations TFIDF and Countvectorizer both give almost similar recommendations but the accuracy
of TF-IDF based systems is much higher. In the case of Collaborative Filtering, the surprise package have been used and considered five algorithms- SVD, SVDpp, KNN-Baseline,
Baseline-only, Co-Clustering. Among these, the SVDpp gives the lowest RMSE.
